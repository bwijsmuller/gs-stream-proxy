Gs-stream-proxy is just a set of classes, and next to that it also builds to an example application that demonstrates the streaming concept.

= Details =

Usecase: client want to write a relatively large object to a regular outputstream (that can be wrapped) to a remote location offered by remoting through gigaspaces.

The concept works as follows:

 * The server (any node on a cluster) offers an RMI service having an arbitrary method
 * The client calls the remote method
 * In this method the server creates an outputstream and passes it to a stream proxy factory.
 * The factory returns a proxy object to pass to the client.
 * The service method returns the proxy.
 * The client can create an (local) outputstream using the proxy.
 * When the client writes to the outputstream, it in turn writes to a remote space.
 * All writes to the remote space are picked up asynchronously and the data is written to the serverside outputstream.
 * When the client closes the outputstream, the stream passes the message and on the server the outputstream is closed also.

The reverse is also implemented, using an local inputstream to read from a remote location.
